The intention of this package is to make packaging R code
as easy as possible. roxyPackage uses tools from the
roxygen2 package to generate documentation. It also
automatically generates and updates files like *-package.R,
DESCRIPTION, CITATION, ChangeLog and NEWS.Rd. Building
packages supports source format, as well as several binary
formats (MS Windows, Mac OS X, Debian GNU/Linux) if the
package contains pure R code only. The packages built are
stored in a fully functional local R package repository
which can be synced to a web server to share them with
others. This includes the generation of browsable HTML
pages similar to CRAN, with support for RSS feeds from the
ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for a more detailed
explanation by example.
