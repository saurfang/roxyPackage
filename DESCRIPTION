Imports: tools
Description: The intention of this package is to make packaging R code as easy
    as possible. roxyPackage uses tools from the roxygen2 package to generate
    documentation. It also automatically generates and updates files like
    *-package.R, DESCRIPTION, CITATION, ChangeLog and NEWS.Rd. Building
    packages supports source format, as well as several binary formats (MS
    Windows, Mac OS X, Debian GNU/Linux) if the package contains pure R code
    only. The packages built are stored in a fully functional local R package
    repository which can be synced to a web server to share them with others.
    This includes the generation of browsable HTML pages similar to CRAN, with
    support for RSS feeds from the ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for a
    more detailed explanation by example.
